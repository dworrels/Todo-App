# React To-Do List Web App
This is a simple and interactive **To-Do list** web application built using **React JS** and **Tailwind CSS**. The app allows users to manage their tasks, mark them as complete/incomplete, and delete them with ease. Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so your to-do list persists even after you close and reopen the browser.

## Features
- **Add Tasks:** Users can input new tasks via an input field.
- **Mark as Complete/Incomplete:** Clicking on a task toggles its status between complete and incomplete.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks from the list using a bin icon.
- **Persistent Data:** All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so the list remains available when the page is refreshed or the browser is reopened.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is styled using Tailwind CSS, ensuring it adapts smoothly to all screen sizes and devices.
